NAME
    Color::Swatch::ASE::Reader - Low-Level ASE (Adobe Swatch Exchange) File
    decoder

VERSION
    version 0.001000

SYNOPSIS
      use Color::Swatch::ASE::Reader;
      my $hash = Color::Swatch::ASE::Reader->read_file(q[./myfile.ase]);
      print Dumper($hash);

    This at present is very low-level simple structure decoding, and is
    probably not useful to most people.

    Its based on the reverse-engineered specification of Adobeâ„¢'s "Swatch
    Exchange" format, which can be found documented many places:
