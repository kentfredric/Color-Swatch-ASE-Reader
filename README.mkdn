# NAME

Color::Swatch::ASE::Reader - Low-Level ASE (Adobe Swatch Exchange) File decoder

# VERSION

version 0.001004

# SYNOPSIS

    use Color::Swatch::ASE::Reader;
    my $hash = Color::Swatch::ASE::Reader->read_file(q[./myfile.ase]);
    print Dumper($hash);

    # {
    #   signature => 'ASEF',
    #   version   => [ 1, 0 ],
    #   blocks    => [
    #     { type => 'group_start', group => 13, label => "My Swatch" },
    #     { type => 'color',
    #         group => 1,  label => "Some Shade",
    #         model => 'RGB ', values => [ 0.9, 0.8, 0.7 ], color_type => 2 },
    #     { type => 'group_end' },
    #   ]
    # }

This at present is very low-level simple structure decoding, and is probably not useful to most people.

Its based on the reverse-engineered specification of Adobeâ„¢'s "Swatch Exchange" format, which can be found documented many places:
